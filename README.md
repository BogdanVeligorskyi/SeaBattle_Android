# SeaBattle_Android
Repository for my implementation for Android devices of iconic Sea Battle game.
In the process of development Java and Android Studio IDE were used.

In this two-player game all communications between Your and Opponent use Local Area Network (LAN) connection and Socket interface.
In order to run this application you need to install game for Android device (at least Android 4.2 is required). 
After that choose your role: Host (Server) or Guest (Client). Host is a device which waits for the Guest to connect. 
In 'Settings' you must enter correct Host and Guest IP-addresses. 
After you have placed all your ships, you need to click on 'Continue' button (Host must do it earlier than Guest). 
And then game starts. If it`s your move just click desired cell on the Opponent board. 
Rules are the same as in the classic Sea Battle game.

PLEASE NOTE: your Android device must be visible in your LAN (you can check it by using ping utility in Command Line).
