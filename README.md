My implementation of iconic Sea Battle game for Android devices.

## Features

1. Sea Battle game itself via LAN.
2. Dark and White modes.

## Available languages

English

## Used technologies

Java, Android Studio (2021.3)

## How to run application

In order to run this application you need to download correponding APK-file and run it on your Android device.
After that choose your role: Host (Server) or Guest (Client). Host is a device which waits for the Guest to connect. 
In 'Settings' you must enter correct Host and Guest IP-addresses. 
After you have placed all your ships, you need to click on 'Continue' button (Host must do it earlier than Guest). 
And then game starts. If it`s your move just click desired cell on the Opponent board. 
Rules are the same as in the classic Sea Battle game.

PLEASE NOTE: your Android device must be visible in your LAN (you can check it by using ping utility in Command Line) and have at least OS Android 4.2.
